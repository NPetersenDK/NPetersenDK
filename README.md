### Who am I?
My name is Nikolaj Petersen and I work as an DevOps Engineer for Aarhus University in Denmark. I try to automise as much as possible in my daily work, some of it might show up here. Read more about me on my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nipetersen

### Lab:
I love having a LAB to test things out in, using VMware and all their products (NSX, VSAN, vRA, ESX). Automating everything from lab-deployments, to container solutions, and everything in between. Using new langauages and all the stuff that shouldnt be on a production environment :)
Coding in:
- PowerShell
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- Node.JS (Very little)

### Volunteer Work:
- eSport Brande (https://esport-brande.dk). We have a lot of Counter-Strike, Minecraft and other servers that needs to be standarlized and automated deployments. We host LAN events a few time a year with tournaments and more.
- NPF (Now closed, sadly). 10 times as a participant, and one time as a Volunteer for the network crew.

### IOT
I love IOT, and all the fun stuff it gives. I also do automations in YAML using Home Assistant, but also a lot of Python connected to fx MQTT to do a thing when a event happens.
